/**
 * Small durable JSON files in the app's user-data folder.
 *
 * Two things outlive a restart but are not session history: the multi-agent run's
 * state, and the queue of commands waiting for the Chrome extension. Both are tiny,
 * both are rewritten whole, and losing either one silently is the failure that matters
 * — a pending worker→prime message or a "resume in a new chat" command that evaporates
 * because the app was reopened is exactly the class of loss this app exists to prevent.
 *
 * So: write to a temp file, rename over the target (atomic on NTFS), and coalesce
 * bursts on a short timer so a chatty broker does not rewrite the file per message.
 * A parse failure returns null rather than throwing — a corrupt state file must cost
 * the pending work, never the app's ability to start.
