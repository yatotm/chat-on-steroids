/**
 * The local MCP endpoint.
 *
 * Bound to 127.0.0.1 on an ephemeral port, never 0.0.0.0, so nothing on the LAN can
 * reach it. Four independent checks run before any MCP handling:
 *   1. the request path must carry the per-session secret token
 *   2. the Host header must be loopback (DNS rebinding protection)
 *   3. a present Origin header must be loopback (a browser cannot drive this endpoint)
 *   4. the body must be within a sane size
 *
 * The MCP handler is built per request from live config, so toggling a permission in
 * the UI takes effect on the very next call without restarting anything.
 *
 * Two things here exist purely because of what talks to this server. tunnel-client
 * runs OAuth discovery (RFC 9728) against it on every start and decodes whatever
 * comes back as JSON without looking at the status code, so this server answers the
 * protected-resource metadata request properly and never emits a non-JSON body.
