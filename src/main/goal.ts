/**
 * The goal loop — a second model, standing in for the user, that keeps a chat moving.
 *
 * ChatGPT finishes a long turn. Somebody has to decide whether all concrete work/questions the
 * user actually requested were clearly completed, and for an unattended run that somebody is an
 * OpenRouter model given the same conversation and a strict continuation-gate instruction. The
 * stock policy keeps going while a requested item is not clearly resolved, but still treats an
 * explicit whole-job completion claim as authoritative and never invents extra work.
 * OpenRouter is asked for a strict `{ action, reply }` decision and the app validates it before
 * anything reaches the browser; provider reasoning, tokenizer markers and malformed protocol
 * output are never user messages. That is the whole feature, and the two halves live in different
 * places for a reason:
 *
 *   · The *page* owns "the turn is really over". Only the browser can tell a finished answer
 *     from a mid-turn redraw, a tool call, or a reload replaying yesterday's transcript, and
 *     it already has that machinery — the same settle barrier a compaction goes through.
 *   · This module owns everything after that: the context, the credential, the request, and
 *     the one draft per chat that the page is allowed to send.
 *
 * ## Why the app makes the call and not the extension
 *
 * The API key is a real credential. It lives in the same DPAPI blob as everything else the
 * app holds and never leaves the main process, so the extension is handed a *reply* rather
 * than a key. That also means the context is built from the local recording, which is the
 * authoritative copy of what was said — the page's DOM is a rendering of it, and a rendering
 * that has been scrolled, virtualised and re-mounted for six hours.
 *
 * ## What is sent
 *
 * Authored user messages, ChatGPT commentary and final answers, in order, plus
 * the Compact & Resume bootstrap that the replacement chat actually received. Of tool calls
 * only a count per turn, so work that ran is not mistaken for a claim: no tool names,
 * no arguments, no results, no file contents. The goal model is deciding whether the user's
 * request has been satisfied, and the conversation is the only evidence it needs for that;
 * the rest is this machine's business and does not leave it.
 *
 * ## One draft per chat
 *
 * A draft is keyed by the generation it answers. A second request for the same turn is the
 * same draft — a retried POST, a reloaded tab, two observers of one settle — and is answered
 * with what already exists rather than by asking the model twice and sending two messages
 * into somebody's conversation.

 * The opening message for a chat that does not exist yet.

 * Every other draft in this module belongs to a conversation: it is keyed by one, streamed
 * onto that conversation's activity feed, and acknowledged against it. A New Chat given a
 * goal has none of that — ChatGPT assigns an id only once a message has been sent, which is
 * the very message being asked for here — so this one is a plain request and a plain answer,
 * awaited by the page that will type it.
 *
 * It is deliberately not idempotent, because there is nothing yet to key idempotency to. The
 * page holds that end: one save, one call, and the result goes into an empty composer. It also
 * holds the retry: this function classifies transient failures with the same authority as an
 * ordinary draft, and the page rechecks that it is still the same empty New Chat before asking
 * again. Provider work never retries in the background after the page has moved elsewhere.
 *
 * `named` is the mode the user chose while writing the goal, for the one case where the mode
 * cannot be read from a chat: there is no chat yet. Without it this drafted the opening under
 * the standing switch, which is how a run started from "add specific loop" could open — and
 * then continue — as a Goal.

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Typing it, rather than writing it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Two things give away a chat message a model composed, and neither of them survives being
 * asked nicely in a system prompt.
 *
 * The first is the em dash. It is not on a keyboard, nobody reaches for it halfway through
 * firing off a follow-up, and one of them in a lowercase two-sentence message is the whole
 * tell on its own.
 *
 * The second is that the message is *clean*. Real messages in a conversation like this one
 * have a dropped apostrophe or a transposed pair in them, because the person typing them did
 * not go back to fix it. A model asked to write casually still writes correctly.
 *
 * Both are applied to the finished reply, after `NO_REPLY` has been ruled out: the stopping
 * condition is matched against what the model actually said, never against a string this
 * file has been editing.
 *
 * ## Why none of it is random
 *
 * One finished turn is one message. A retried POST, a second observer and a reloaded tab all
 * ask for the same draft again, and the idempotency that keeps two messages out of somebody's
 * conversation only holds if asking twice returns the identical string. Anything drawn from a
 * clock or `Math.random` would quietly turn one draft into several different messages
 * depending on who asked and when. So the seed is the draft itself.

 * closing a line is a bullet or a trailing thought and simply goes, a dash already sitting
 * against punctuation leaves a space behind, and a dash between two digits is a range and
